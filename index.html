<div id="about">
<p>	Hi, I'm Sam. I do a little of this and a little of that at <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>; primarily fieldtech work with a side of software development. I graduated from <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a> with a B.A. in Computer Science, and a minor in French. At Cal, I was a Unit Supervisor for <a href="http://rescomp.berkeley.edu">Residential Computing</a>, Berkeley's residential ISP. 
</p><p>
I like learning/speaking/listening to foreign languages, traveling the world, playing the flute, and taking <a href="http://juste1image.wordpress.com">photographs</a>. As a current resident of San Francisco, I am fast becoming a coffee addict who hangs out in the park after Sunday brunch.
</p><p>
I can be most easily reached at samiam28 (at) gmail (dot) com, or on the social network of your choice.
